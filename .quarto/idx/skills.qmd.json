The aforementioned is carried out using libraries like PCRaster, Geopandas, Rasterio, among others. Likewise, I am able to generate climatic data inputs (distributed precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, among others) in different map formats through automated methods using Python, such as .tiff, .map, among others.

These tasks are carried out using software like QGIS, ArcGIS, ILWIS, R, and Python. It is important to highlight that I am capable of handling satellite information derived from various geoportals and satellites, including CHIRPS (Precipitation), MODIS (Evapotranspiration), SoilGrids (Soil properties), ALOS PALSAR and SRTM (DEM), SMAP (Soil moisture), Landsat, Google Earth Engine, among others.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: roun-mancha\n::: text_param\n::: contenedor\n## Hydrological modelling\n\n![](uncertainty.jpg) I have the skills to conduct hydrological simulations using distributed, semi-distributed, and lumped hydrological models, such as the SPHY model (Distributed), Topmodel (Semi-distributed), HEC-HMS (Distributed and lumped), HYMOD (lumped model), HBV (lumped), SHIA (lumped), GR2M (lumped), among others.
