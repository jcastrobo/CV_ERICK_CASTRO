Likewise, doing exhaustive exploratory, deterministic, and stochastic processes and analysis which support the hydrological functioning of different ecosystems.\n\n# Hydrological Modelling\n\nOther important topic within my professional profile; it is the hydrological modelling in catchments. I am trained to run distributed models in source code, building their inputs by means of automatized tools in Python using libraries such as: PCRaster, Rasterio, Geopandas, GDAL, among others. Likewise, I am able to write scripts to calibrate and uncertainty estimation (GLUE methodology mainly) of these models. I have also the capacity to run, calibrate and determine the uncertainty in semi-distributed and lumped models. For instance: SPHY (Python), Topmodel (in R), Hymod (Matlab), HBV, GR2M, SHIA, among others. The aforementioned aims to assess hydrological processes under different scenarios either land use or climate; as well as exploring what implications concern when certain assumptions are made.\n\n# Hydraulic of rivers and floods\n\nIn addition, I have got the capacity to evaluate the hydraulic behavior of rivers in function of their media properties (e.g. slope, soil properties, morphometric parameters of its catchment, climate, among other), determining the maximum peak flows expected in response to the rainfall inputs; generating design storms from the intensity-duration-frecuency (IDF) curves to after assess the probable maximum peak flow with its respective period return. It is important to stress that the generated information by the aforementioned I am also able to determine the maximum probable floods from a territory as well as their hot spots.\n\n# Field work\n\nIt is important to stress that I am able to make the analysis and studies as the mentioned early both using satellite data.radar data and field measurements of hydrological, ecological and meteorological variables. Related with the field measurements, I am capacited to implement hydro-meteorological monitoring, installing meteorological stations (Davis Pro), discharge stations (level sensor like: limnigraph or ultrasound sensor), rain gauges (Texas instruments with recoder Hobbo and Tinytag), Soil moisture stations (TDR-Campbell), among others. Regarding to physical and biological aspects of ecosystems, I am able to make soil sampling properties at field such as: Bulk density, Hydraulic conductivity, infiltration, water retention curve, texture, among others.\n\n# Current develop\n\nCurrently, I am master science candidate in Forest Management and Environmental Conservation of the National University of Colombia. In this program I am focused on studying about the ecohydrology of tropical forest and sub-tropical forest (Bolivian Tucuman Forest). My master science project is based on the study and implications of the land use change on the ecohydrological functioning of Bolivian Tucuman Forest and the link throughout different spatio-temporal scales (developing); as well as the parameter regionalization methods to evaluate ungauged catchments. I have taken courses like: Hydrological simulation, Spatial Statistical Analysis, Multivariate Statistic, Machine Learning Applied to Geosciences, Numerical Ecology among others.\n:::\n:::\n:::\n","srcMarkdownNoYaml":"\n\n::: around-profile\n::: text_param\n::: contenedor\n# Professional profile\n:::\n:::\n:::\n\n::: around-profile\n::: text_param\n::: contenedor\n![](me2.png) As Forestal Engineer I am able to generate and answer researcher questions as well as solving different problems related to hydrology and ecohydrology at different spatio-temporal scales (test my wits).
