## Research experience

![](Station.jpg) I have participated in different projects (PARAGUAS, PARAMUNDOS, and Landscape Transformation of Bolivian Forest) within the research group "Hydrology and Ecosystem Modeling (Hidrología y Modelación de Ecosistemas) at the Universidad Nacional de Colombia, Sede Medellín, since 2018 to July 2023. Within my activities, I have developed both field and data analysis works, such as the implementation of hydrological monitoring in catchments, including discharge stations, weather stations, soil moisture stations (TDR), and soil properties sampling, as well as cloud and rain stations.

On the other hand, I have experience related to identifying different environmental problems and generating possible answers to solve these problems. I have experience quantifying hydrological processes across different altitudinal gradients in the Andes Mountains, such as glacier, páramo, and cloud forest.

I also have experience simulating land use changes in different catchments in Bolivia using the "Spatial Processes in Hydrology" model (SPHY), which is a spatially distributed hydrological model that allows the simulation of a plethora of processes, including snow processes, glacier mass balance, rainfall-runoff processes, among others. During the development of the aforementioned work, I have written scripts to carry out the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) methodology to calibrate and determine the uncertainty in the generated simulations.

Finally, I have experience related to the implementation of Machine Learning to forecast maximum discharge in catchments using scarce data, such as Multiple Linear Regression, Random Forest, Support Vector Machine, K-Nearest Neighbor, among others. This is a recent topic that I am currently working on to develop a possible early warning detection system based on both lagging measures (i.e., 24 hours prior to the current rainfall event, previous daily discharge, among others) and rainfall events that have occurred or could happen in the future.
