# Skills

## Programming skills

![](drin.jpg) I am able to program in languages like Python, R, and Matlab, and generate automated tools for geo-spatial operations such as catchment delimitation, flow accumulations, drainage determination, and linking APIs to couple satellite information with the local work environment, among others. The aforementioned is carried out using libraries like PCRaster, Geopandas, Rasterio, among others. Likewise, I am able to generate climatic data inputs (distributed precipitation, evapotranspiration, temperature, among others) in different map formats through automated methods using Python, such as .tiff, .map, among others. In addition, I am capable of running hydrological models in the source code and integrating algorithms for calibration, validation, and uncertainty estimation.

On the other hand, I have skills in handling large databases as well as processing them within a hydrological context, performing hydrological operations in R, such as hydrological response indices, base flow separation, flow direction curves, kriging, and geostatistics for climatic analysis, downscaling, exploratory analysis in hydrology, among others.

I also possess skills in training Machine Learning algorithms applied to geoscience, primarily in hydrology. I can implement different Machine Learning models for classification or regression, as well as algorithms to validate these models, such as K-fold cross-validation, among others.

## Geographic information systems (GIS) skills

![](sig2.jpg) I have skills related to the use of GIS, performing operations such as land cover classification (unsupervised and supervised), dynamic vegetation operations like NDVI estimation, catchment delimitation, morphometry analysis of catchments, map algebra, and geostatistical analysis, among others. These tasks are carried out using software like QGIS, ArcGIS, ILWIS, R, and Python. It is important to highlight that I am capable of handling satellite information derived from various geoportals and satellites, including CHIRPS (Precipitation), MODIS (Evapotranspiration), SoilGrids (Soil properties), ALOS PALSAR and SRTM (DEM), SMAP (Soil moisture), Landsat, Google Earth Engine, among others.

## Hydrological modelling

![](uncertainty.jpg) I have the skills to conduct hydrological simulations using distributed, semi-distributed, and lumped hydrological models, such as the SPHY model (Distributed), Topmodel (Semi-distributed), HEC-HMS (Distributed and lumped), HYMOD (lumped model), HBV (lumped), SHIA (lumped), GR2M (lumped), among others. Moreover, for calibrating these models, I have the skill to generate and use algorithms to calibrate these models as well as estimate uncertainty. I have used my own scripts and the scripts of the CURE toolbox (Page et al., 2023), either in Matlab or Python. I prefer the Generalized Likelihood Uncertainty Estimation (GLUE) approach in hydrological modeling.

In the case of hydraulic modeling, I have the skill to determine the hydraulic behavior of rivers, assessing the probable maximum discharge based on the hydrograph estimation method (SCS, Snyder, Clark, unit model, among others) and synthetic hyetogram derived from IDF curves. I later use these analyses to determine flood plains. These analyses are conducted using software such as HEC-HMS, HEC-RAS, ArcGIS, QGIS, HEC-GeoRAS, R, Python, among others.

## Writing skills

I have the skill to write scientific manuscripts as well as technical reports. The aforementioned is evidenced in my publications carried out. It is important to stress that I can develop this skill both in English and Spanish.
