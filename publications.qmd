## ![](laguna.jpg)Chapter book: Ecohydrological Gradient in Neotropical Montane Ecosystems: From Tropical Montane Forests to Glacier

In this study, the specific climatic and ecohydrological conditions of the three main Neotropical montane ecosystems in Colombia: glaciers, paramos and montane forests; were analyzed ,and disclose the key parameters that control the ecohydrological functioning of these Neotropical montane ecosystems. Collected data from an entire elevational gradient at Río Claro basin within Los Nevados Natural Park (Colombia) allowed us for a comprehensive description of altitudinal climate and ecohydrological gradient and provides evidence of the role of climate, soils and vegetation drivers on ecosystem ecohydrological functioning, their specific role in Neotropical montane water cycle and ecosystem water yield.

## ![](paramo.jpg)Chapter book: Ecohydrological Functioning of Andean Paramos in Colombia

During the period between 2006 to 2019, a research ecohydrological program was carried out in several paramos from the northern Andes, with the aim of characterizing the ecohydrological functioning of these ecosystems and identifying and quantifying the variables that determine this functioning. To this purpose, all the variables of the water balance were detailed measured in seven hydrographic catchments, located in five paramos in Colombia (Guerrero, Belmira, Chingaza, Romerales-Berlín, and Chili-Barragán), such as vertical and horizontal precipitation (fog inputs), the interception of precipitation by the vegetation, the spatial and temporal 435 Funcionamiento ecohidrológico de los páramos en Colombia soil water dynamics and magnitudes and discharge. Likewise, the hydraulic and physical soil properties were characterized, and vegetation variables were measured, such as the leaf area index and the cover fraction by paramo vegetation. The results indicate that inputs of water were in close balance with outputs, and there was some annual groundwater recharge in páramos like Chingaza and Chili-Barragán. In these paramos, average annual rainfall ranged between 1100 and 3200 mm y-1, and water inflows from fog was around 130 mm y-1. Outflows from these ecosystems summarized 33 % of incident precipitation, from which 149 mm y-1 were rainfall interception by paramo vegetation, 481 mm y-1 from actual evapotranspiration and 1366 mm y-1 of total discharge or runoff from the studied catchments. In brief, average water yield was around 70.0 %, which is among the highest values reported from globally terrestrial ecosystems. Both the specific climatic conditions and the characteristics of precipitation (small, frequent and low intensity events), as well as the frequency of fog events, and the almost permanent high soil moisture regime, are the key variables that control the ecohydrological functioning of paramo ecosystems in Colombia, and responsible for their high water yield. This study contributes significantly to the understanding of the ecohydrological functioning of paramo ecosystems in Colombia and provides scientific information to support stakeholders and decision makers.

## ![](river.jpg)Undergraduate thesis (Laureate): Effects of Land Use Changes on the Soil Moisture Dynamics and Hydrological Response of Catchments in Southeast Bolivia

With the objective of recognize the way that the land use and cover type determine, affect and generate implications on the hydrological functioning of the catchments, soil moisture dynamics and hydrological response were evaluated using paired basins, one of these was highly conserved under forest cover (Vg_B) and the other basin was highly altered by pastures, grassland and crops (Vg_P). For the analysis of soil moisture dynamics, the spatio-temporal variations at depth was carried out, for determine loses and increments of soil moisture over time. The hydrological response was evaluated through two types of indices: 1) Water yield index which runoff coefficient and total streamflow was assessed; and 2) water regulation index where at event scale flow recession curves were evaluated through hydrographs according to rainfall characteristics; and at annual scale flow duration curve and water regulation index were assessed. The results show that Vg_B conserve higher soil moisture levels and lower variations across the soil profile in the wet season whereas in Vg_P the soil moisture variability was higher. Nevertheless, the soil moisture decreases during the dry season in Vg_B such is driven by greater evapotranspiration rates compared to Vg_P. According to the hydrological response, Vg_B reflected greater water yield, less runoff coefficient, higher regulation of its flow duration curve and a higher water regulation index compared to Vg_P. At event scale, it was found that hydrological response is determined by rainfall characteristics where Vg_B presented differences between the hydrological response variables. In addition, the hydrological response generated by higher intensity events was different statistically among basins, where these events generate longer hydrological response and of grater residence time expressed by the flow recession curves, whereas this was different in Vg_P. Notwithstanding, in the hydrological response in function of medium and lower intensity (\<10 mm) was not found a statistical difference in the flow recession curves among Vg_B and Vg_P, as consequence of dominant factors such as: high rainfall interception in Vg_B and the soil properties alterations which affect the hydrological functioning of basins. This jobs it concludes that both the weather and the land use change are sources which drive spatio-temporal variation of soil moisture, due to the Bolivian Tucuman Forest keep higher soil moisture level in the wet seasons as well as lower variation whereas in the dry season this reduces its soil moisture levels and increases the temporal variation compared to the pastures and grassland basin (Vg_P). In addition, it thesis concludes that the land use change of Bolivian Tucuman Forest determine the hydrological response at annual scale regarding to water yield and water regulation. On the other hand, the rainfall characteristics determine the hydrological response significantly due to the high intensity events generate a positive issue regarding to the base flow recharge in the forest basin due to this generates longer flow recession curves compared to the grassland basin (Vg_P).
