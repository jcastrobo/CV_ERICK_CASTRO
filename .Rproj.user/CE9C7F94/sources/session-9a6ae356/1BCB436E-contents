# Work experience

## ![](mancha.jpg)

I have four years of experience by making hydrological studies of catchments in the area of environmental sciences and projects.

I have three years of experience related to the hydro-meteorological monitoring in catchments of variables such as: Climate, discharge, soil moisture, rain, infiltration, among others.

I have 2 year of experience doing hydrologic-hydraulic study by through independent consultancy, estimating the probable maximum discharge in function of rainfall inputs derived to the design storms; to risk assessment in urban areas as well as the flood plains and their hot spots. I have also done frequency analysis in hydrology to determine the occurrence probability of maximum events either of rainfall event or maximum peak flows.

I have 6 months of experience working with local communities in the topic of socio-hydrology, applying with them the Theory of Change (ToC); to capacite the communities about the hydrological functioning of the PÃ ramo ecosystem to arise their awareness regarding to the importance of protecting these ecosystem and changing ideas over their economic activities like: replace the grasland for livestocks and crops for ecotourism or others.

![](section.jpeg) I have 2 year of experience simulating scenarios of land use change using distributed, semidistributed and lumped hydrological models in catchments.

Finally, I have taught in undergradaute courses of hydrology specific topics like: Frecuency analysis in hydrology, return period, IDF curves, Spatial processes in hydrology (Kriging, IDW, among others), hydrological response and indices to assess it (runoff ratio, water regulation index, R-B flashiness index, flow duration curve, among others), base flow separation methods, hydropedology, among others.
