![](me2.png) As a Forest Engineer, I am able to generate and answer research questions as well as solve different problems related to hydrology and ecohydrology at different spatio-temporal scales. Likewise, I conduct exhaustive exploratory, deterministic, and stochastic processes and analyses that support the hydrological functioning of various ecosystems.

# Hydrological Modelling

Another important topic within my professional profile is hydrological modeling in catchments. I am trained to run distributed models in source code, build their inputs using automated tools in Python, using libraries such as PCRaster, Rasterio, Geopandas, GDAL, among others. Likewise, I am capable of writing scripts for calibration and uncertainty estimation, mainly using the GLUE methodology for these models. I also have the capacity to run, calibrate, and determine uncertainty in semi-distributed and lumped models, such as SPHY (Python), Topmodel (in R), Hymod (Matlab), HBV, GR2M, SHIA, among others. The aforementioned aims to assess hydrological processes under different scenarios, including land use and climate, as well as exploring the implications when certain assumptions are made.

# Hydraulic of rivers and floods

In addition, I have the capacity to evaluate the hydraulic behavior of rivers based on their physical properties (e.g., slope, soil properties, morphometric parameters of their catchment, climate, among others), determining the maximum peak flows expected in response to rainfall inputs. I generate design storms from the intensity-duration-frequency (IDF) curves to subsequently assess the probable maximum peak flow with its respective return period. It is important to stress that the information generated by the aforementioned methods can also be used to determine the maximum probable floods in a territory, as well as their hot spots.

# Field work

It is important to emphasize that I am capable of conducting analyses and studies as mentioned earlier, using satellite data, radar data, and field measurements of hydrological, ecological, and meteorological variables. Regarding field measurements, I am qualified to implement hydro-meteorological monitoring, including the installation of meteorological stations (Davis Pro), discharge stations (level sensors like limnigraph or ultrasound sensors), rain gauges (Texas Instruments with Hobbo and Tinytag recorders), soil moisture stations (TDR-Campbell), among others. Concerning physical and biological aspects of ecosystems, I can perform soil sampling in the field for properties such as bulk density, hydraulic conductivity, infiltration, water retention curve, texture, among others.

# Current develop

Currently, I am master science candidate in Forest Management and Environmental Conservation of the National University of Colombia. In this program I am focused on studying about the ecohydrology of tropical forest and sub-tropical forest (Bolivian Tucuman Forest). My master science project is based on the study and implications of the land use change on the ecohydrological functioning of Bolivian Tucuman Forest and the link throughout different spatio-temporal scales (developing); as well as the parameter regionalization methods to evaluate ungauged catchments. I have taken courses like: Hydrological simulation, Spatial Statistical Analysis, Multivariate Statistic, Machine Learning Applied to Geosciences, Numerical Ecology among others.
